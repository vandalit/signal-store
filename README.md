## 🧩 **Key Components & Learning Focus**

### **1. Cart State Service** 📊
**File:** `src/app/shared/data-access/cart-state.service.ts`

**Learning Focus:**
- Angular Signals for reactive state
- ngxtension/signal-slice for complex state management
- RxJS integration with signals
- Computed signals for derived data
- Immutable state updates
- Local storage persistence

**Key Concepts:**
```typescript
// Signal-based state management
state = signalSlice({
  initialState: this.initialState,
  sources: [this.loadProducts$],
  actionSources: { add: ... },
  effects: { saveProducts: ... }
});

// Computed signals for derived data
count = computed(() => 
  this.state().products.reduce((total, item) => total + item.quantity, 0)
);
```

### **2. Header Component** 🧭
**File:** `src/app/shared/ui/header/header.ts`

**Learning Focus:**
- Standalone component architecture
- Angular Router integration
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Conditional rendering with @if control flow
- Component-service communication

**Key Concepts:**
```typescript
@Component({
  standalone: true,                    // No NgModule needed
  imports: [RouterLink, RouterLinkActive], // Direct imports
  template: `
    @if (cartCount() > 0) {           // New control flow syntax
      <span>{{ cartCount() }}</span>
    }
  `
})
```

### **3. Product Components** 🛍️
**Files:** `src/app/products/`

**Learning Focus:**
- Feature-based architecture
- Smart vs. Dumb component patterns
- Input/Output communication
- Event handling and propagation
- Responsive grid layouts
